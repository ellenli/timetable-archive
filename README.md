# The Timetable Generator

This repo holds the _earliest iterations_ of unpublished frontend developments for [The Timetable Generator](https://www.timetablegenerator.io/). The generator helps university students plan out their courses and schedules for the school year.

View these iterations via this repo and http://ellen.li/timetable-archive.

For the latest (experimental) frontend, check out [my timetable repo](https://github.com/ellenli/timetable).

Thanks for dropping by.
